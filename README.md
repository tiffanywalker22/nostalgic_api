# Custom API From Scratch

## Project Context
Using all of the skills you’ve developed over the last two trimesters, you’re going to team up with a partner in creating your very own API
from start to finish. You’ll develop a design, narrow down what should be in your MVP (minimum viable product), and work together as a team
to bring your idea to life. You have a limited number of days to work on this project, so be sure to keep your scope reasonable for you and your team.

## Challenge
There is one rule that must be followed…your application must follow the theme, “Nostalgia!”. You and your team are free to interpret that in any
way you see fit (keep it Safe For Work, though)! If you are interested in continuing where you left off on your Bob Ross API, feel free to use
that as the starting point for this project and expand upon

## Project Proposal
This project aims to recreate the magic of our childhood bedrooms by providing an API that serves data about popular nostalgic bedrooms,
complete with descriptions and images. The data is transferred to a webpage where these bedrooms are displayed,
taking users on a trip down memory lane.

## Project Overview
This API is built from scratch with a theme centered around nostalgia. It serves as a custom API that provides detailed information about
popular nostalgic bedrooms, including descriptions and images. The data is displayed on a webpage created using React,
offering users a visually appealing and heartwarming experience.
